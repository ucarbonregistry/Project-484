“3.99 MW hybrid project by M/s Shreeji Coke and Energy Pvt. Ltd

The proposed project titled under UCR is “3.99 MW hybrid project by M/s Shreeji Coke and Energy
Pvt. Ltd.”, which is wind and solar power project located in Amreli district in the state of Gujarat
(India). The purpose of this plant installation and power generation is for captive consumption. PP has
the full ownership of the project activity. The project is an operational activity with continuous
reduction of GHG, currently being applied under “Universal Carbon Registry” (UCR).

The purpose of the proposed project activity is to generate electricity using a clean and renewable
source of energy. This project has been promoted by M/s Shreeji Coke and Energy Pvt. Ltd. The
project activity was commissioned on 01/05/2023 by Gujarat Energy Development Agency (GEDA),
Government of Gujarat, India.

The proposed project activity of 3.99 MW is installation and operation of solar and wind power as
per below mentioned details.
__________
Type/ Taluka District/Total installed Capacity/Commissioning date
____________
Wind/ Khambha Amreli/ 2.1 MW/ 01/05/2023
______________
Solar /Savar Kundla/ 1.89 MW /01/05/2023

The net generated electricity from the project activity is used for captive consumption by the
project proponent (PP). Wheeling agreement is signed between Paschim Gujarat Vij Company Ltd.
(PGVCL) and PP. The project activity would be displacing equivalent quantum of grid electricity
resulting in emission reduction of 6,291 tCO2 per annum. The project activity has been helping in
greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction by using renewable resources for generating power which
otherwise would have been generated using grid mix power plants, which is dominated by fossil fuel
based thermal powerplants.

Since the project activity generates electricity through wind and solar energy, a clean renewable
energy source it will not cause any negative impact on the environment and thereby contributes to
climate change mitigation efforts.
